## haskell-web-anki (flashcard for electron and web)

This repository contains my start with both: any web development, functional reactive programming.
It uses great Ryan Trinkle's library Reflex (and Reflex-DOM).
It's not very usable atm, but if you're Haskell geek and have some time for setting it up 
and flashcards to memoize (prepared as images), then go ahead and try.

The code is a mess, full of patches and experiments. But should compile (may require some additional tinkering)
to an electron app using scripts in top directory. At first it was meant to be a web application, that's why it's split into 
server (haskell servant) and frontend application. Both parts are written almost exclusively in Haskell.
Frontend is compiled to JS using amazing GHCJS.
